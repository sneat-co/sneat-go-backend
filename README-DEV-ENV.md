# Setting up dev environment

## GOPRIVATE

This project uses private repositories. To be able to download them you need to set `GOPRIVATE` environment variable.

    export GOPRIVATE="github.com/sneat-co/sneat-mod-logistus,github.com/sneat-co/sneat-mod-datatug"

You can add this to your shell profile, e.g. `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile` or whatever you use.
