<h2>Lyrics</h2>
<pre>
I owe you, but how come its took me this too long to say it
'cause I have been hiding the truth
Didn't think I'd let you in on this shit.
But you know I wouldn't be here
If it wasn't for you, you see I've tried this on my own,
I owe you, imagine if I never got to see you again.
I'm gonna bite my tongue next time that you're speaking,
'cause you deserve the time a day.
I abused your kindness with my weakness and threw it in your face.
Way to go, way to go, what a joke, I'm a joke,
If only you could see how I feel.
You bite your tongue next time that I'm screaming,
See, I ain't angry with you.

There's no escaping what I've done,
I hope you hear these words,
Lord, strike me down if any one of them's untrue.
You are the reason I am what I've become, I owe you.
Even though you don't want nothing, I owe you one.

Hand on heart, I don't think there's any other way to say this.
I admit being a prick didn't do me any favors,
I mean, I've been called every name under the sun's in my eyes,
But it feels pitch black inside,
I swear I put you through so much, now I couldn't lie to you if I tried
I admit acting a fool didn't do me any favors,
Imagine if I never got to see you again.

I bite my tongue next time that you're speaking,
'cause you deserve the time a day.
I abuse your kindness with my weakness,
and threw it in your face.
Way to go, way to go, what a joke, I'm a joke,
If only you could see how I feel.
You bite your tongue next time that I'm screaming,
See, I ain't angry with you.

There's no escaping what I've done,
I hope you hear these words,
Lord, strike me down if any one of them's untrue.
See, you are the reason I am what I've become, I owe you.
Even though you don't want nothing, I owe you one.

Just be with me, let me speak to me,
I'm so sorry if I've drained you out.
That's why I love you,
And I hope you're glad you made me finally see it
That I'm nothing without you
Just tell me, imma see you again?

I swear I'll bite my tongue next time that you're speaking,
'cause you deserve the time a day.
I abuse your kindness with my weakness,
and threw it in your face.
Way to go, way to go, what a joke, I'm a joke,
If only you could see how I feel.
You bite your tongue next time that I'm screaming,
See, I ain't angry with you.

There's no escaping what I've done,
I hope you hear these words,
Lord, strike me down if any one of them's untrue.
'cause you are the reason I am what I've become, I owe you.
Even though you owe me nothing, I owe you one.
But you owe me nothing, 'cause I owe you one.
