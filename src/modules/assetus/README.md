# Assets module

Asset is something owned by a person/family/team/company.

Good examples of an asset:

- a car
- a house
- a book

Every asset can be assigned to a space/team member (_e.g. a primary caretaker_).

There could be some documents/contracts associated with an asset
(_for example insurance policy or a lease_).
